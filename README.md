# Stock Market Analysis

## Project Overview 
Analyzing the stock market is crucial for making informed decisions on our investments. I leveraged Yahoo Finance API to collect real-time data for each ticker over the last 6 months. 

This analysis involves calculating moving averages (8MA & 21MA) and daily range, measuring volatility, and conducting correlation analysis to gain a better understanding of price action and the factors that affect the stock price. Those factors include but aren't limited to:

1. Earnings season

2. Economic news

3. Industry trends

4. Seasonality

5. Market conditions
